## Description
<!-- This is an Angular e-commerce app that fetches data from an API and allows users to login with a token that expires after 1 hour. The app also uses the ngx-skeleton-loader library to handle data loading and ngx-infinite-scroll to load more products as the user scrolls down the page. -->
This is an Angular E-commerce application that allows users to browse products, add products to cart.The application fetches product data through an API. It also implements the concept of lazy loading with the application divided into modules.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can browse products, add products to cart . You can also sort products by price or name. The application uses ngx-infinite-scroll to load more products as the user scrolls down the page.


The application is divided into modulesand Lazy loading is used to optimize the loading of modules.





* Product List.
The app displays a list of products fetched from the API. When the user first loads the page, the ngx-skeleton-loader library is used to display a loading animation until the data is fetched from the API.

As the user scrolls down the page, the ngx-infinite-scroll library is used to load more products from the API. The app uses a pagination system to request the next page of products from the API.

* Product Details.
When the user clicks on a product in the list, they are taken to a page that displays the details of a product when the user clicks on the product card. The product details page displays the product name, price, description, and a list of related products. -->
